# Data Science Internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions

This repository contains the tasks and projects I worked on as part of my internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**. As a Data Science intern, I applied my knowledge of data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning to real-world datasets, including sales data analysis, customer behavior analysis, and more.

## Projects
