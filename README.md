# Data Science Internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions

This repository contains the tasks and projects I worked on as part of my internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**. As a Data Science intern, I applied my knowledge of data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning to real-world datasets, including sales data analysis, customer behavior analysis, and more.

## Projects

### 1. **Sales Data Analysis of Walmart**
   - **Objective**: Analyzed Walmart's sales data to identify patterns and trends, focusing on factors like **Weekly Sales**, **Unemployment**, **CPI (Consumer Price Index)**, and **Holiday Flags**.
   - **Key Activities**:
     - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify relationships between sales and economic indicators.
     - Visualization of sales trends over time.
     - Analysis of the impact of **Unemployment** and **CPI** on sales performance.
   - **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
### 2. Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews
   **Overview**:
   This project is the second task of my internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions. The task involved analyzing social media data to understand public sentiment towards various topics, products, or events. For this assignment, I applied the techniques to an Amazon Reviews dataset to explore customer sentiments.
   
   -**Objective**:
   To perform sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
   To preprocess and clean textual data for better analysis.
   To extract and classify sentiment scores as positive, negative, or neutral.
   To visualize sentiment trends and identify patterns in customer reviews.
   
   -**Key Steps**:
   1. Data Preprocessing
   Removed unnecessary elements like punctuation, numbers, and stopwords.
   Performed case normalization and lemmatization for textual consistency.
   2. Textual Visualization
   Created word clouds and bar charts to highlight frequent terms in reviews.
   Analyzed trends in common words for positive and negative reviews.
   3. Sentiment Analysis
   Utilized VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) to compute sentiment polarity scores.
   Classified reviews into positive or negative sentiments using machine learning models.
   4. Modeling
   Built and evaluated models for sentiment classification:
   Logistic Regression
   Random Forest Classifier
   Achieved high accuracy (>80%) using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer features.
   -**Technologies Used**:
   Python: Primary programming language.
   Libraries:
   Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
   NLP: nltk, TextBlob
   Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud
   Machine Learning: sklearn
